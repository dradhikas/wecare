This website is a small overview of a big and very creative idea of providing all the essential services to all the elderly citizens on one click. By essential services here I mean medical services available nearby, various technical facilities which these people are not acquainted with and also some domestic services like providing the cell phone numbers of househelpers, carpenters, plumbers etc.
	There are many websites that provide online video calls to doctors, home delivery of medicines, online bill payments, online reservations, online shopping of groceries, online food delivery and apps like urban clap are providing various services at ease of location. But we need to go and browse through various websites and do appropriate research.
	In my idea this website should provide the results based on city name and areas. We can also co-ordinate with various different companies which provide these kind of services to enhance the variety and quality of content.
The given website I have not included the database due to lack of time. Thatâ€™s why it can not be used in real life, and it needs to undergo lots of changes in order to be on web.
Thank you.
